  ## Description
  This project was made as a text editor application that can be downloaded and used even when offline.

  ## Lessons and Challenges 
  Though I got the application to work I'm still a bit shaky on indexedDB. I wasn't able to get the header to display for some reason. Maybe in the future I can revisit this project and fix that issue.

  ## Installation
  clone the repository then run npm i to install necessary packages.

  ## Usage 
  Either connect to the app via the Heroku link or run locally and navigate to the local host port the server chooses. Alternatively you can download the app to use offline.
